# GitHub Actions Workflow

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and push multi-architecture Docker images to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) using **native runners** for maximum speed.

## Workflow Features

- **üöÄ Native Builds**: Uses `ubuntu-24.04` for AMD64 and `ubuntu-24.04-arm64` for ARM64
- **‚ö° Parallel Execution**: Builds both architectures simultaneously for speed
- **üîí Automatic Authentication**: Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` for secure access to GHCR
- **üíæ Smart Caching**: Architecture-specific GitHub Actions cache
- **üè∑Ô∏è Architecture-Specific Tags**: Creates detailed tags with all version information
- **üì¶ Manifest Creation**: Creates multi-arch manifests for seamless platform detection

## Build Architecture

### Job Structure
```yaml
jobs:
  build-amd64:     # Runs on ubuntu-24.04 (native x86_64)
  build-arm64:     # Runs on ubuntu-24.04-arm64 (native aarch64) 
  create-manifest: # Combines both images with manifests
```

### Performance Benefits
- **No Emulation**: Native builds are ~10x faster than emulated cross-compilation
- **Parallel Execution**: Both architectures build simultaneously
- **Optimized Caching**: Separate cache scopes for each architecture

## Generated Tags

The workflow generates two architecture-specific tags with multi-arch manifests:

```
ghcr.io/manticoresoftware/rust-min-libc:amd64-rust1.86.0-glibc2.17-openssl1.0.1u
ghcr.io/manticoresoftware/rust-min-libc:aarch64-rust1.86.0-glibc2.28-openssl1.1.1w
```

**Note**: Each tag works on both platforms - Docker automatically selects the correct architecture via the manifest.

## Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
- Push to `main` or `master` branch
- Git tags starting with `v*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Pull requests (build only, no push)

### Manual Trigger
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub repository
2. Select **"Build and Push Multi-Architecture Docker Images"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Select branch and confirm

## Configuration

All versions and settings are configured in the workflow environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  IMAGE_NAME: manticoresoftware/rust-min-libc
  RUST_VERSION: "1.86.0"
  AMD64_GLIBC_VERSION: "2.17"
  AMD64_OPENSSL_VERSION: "1.0.1u"
  ARM64_GLIBC_VERSION: "2.28"
  ARM64_OPENSSL_VERSION: "1.1.1w"
```

## Making Package Public

After the first successful build, make the package public:

1. Go to: https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticore/pkgs/container/rust-min-libc
2. Click **"Package settings"**
3. Scroll to **"Danger Zone"**
4. Click **"Change package visibility"**
5. Select **"Public"**

## Permissions

The workflow has the necessary permissions:
- `contents: read` - To read repository content
- `packages: write` - To push to GitHub Container Registry
- `id-token: write` - For enhanced security

No additional secrets or tokens are required - it uses the automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
